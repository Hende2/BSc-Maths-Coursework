    "### A number game\n",
    "$n$ positive integer numbers $a_0,a_1,a_2,\\dots,a_{n-1}\\in\\mathbb{N}$ are arranged in a circle as shown in Figure 1 below. Each number lies in the range $2,\\dots,m$ for some positive integer $m\\in \\mathbb{N}$: for all $j\\in\\{0,1,\\dots,n-1\\}$ we have that $2\\le a_j\\le m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following game: starting at some position $k_0\\in\\{0,1,\\dots,n-1\\}$ which we are free to choose, we can move around the circle in the clockwise direction. If at some point in this process we are at the number $a_k$, we can either take a step of size $1$ without receiving any reward, or take a step of size $a_k$ and receive a reward of $a_k^2$. The process is repeated until we return to the position $k_0$ while moving around the circle exactly once in $S$ steps (this is only possible if the sum of the stepsizes adds up to $n$). For each way of going around the circle in this way we are interested in the total reward $R$ which is defined as\n",

Assuming that we are at position $k$ at some point in the process, we can move forward either by taking a step of size $1$ for a reward of zero or we can take a step of size $b_k$ for a reward of size $b_k^2$. The game ends if we finish exactly one step after position $n-1$, as shown in Figure 2 below. As above, the total reward $\\widehat{R}$ is the sum over the awards in all steps.\n",
